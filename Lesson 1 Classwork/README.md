# üêç Day 1: Intro to Python & Google Colab

Welcome to INFO 450! Today was all about getting started with Python for Business Analytics.

## ‚úÖ What We Did

- **Explored Google Colab**
  - How to run code cells (`Shift+Enter`)
  - How to add text cells for notes and explanations

- **Learned Python Basics**
  - Printing text with `print()`
  - Using comments with `#`
  - Simple math operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, `%`

- **Worked with Variables**
  - Assigning values: `x = 5`
  - Naming rules and conventions
  - Using variables in operations

- **Basic Data Types**
  - Integers: `int`
  - Floats: `float`
  - Strings: `str`
  - Booleans: `True`, `False`

- **Mini Challenge**
  - Created and printed variables like `first_name`, `age`, and a favorite quote.

## üß† Key Takeaways

- Google Colab is like a smart notebook where you write code, test it, and explain your thoughts.
- Python is readable, beginner-friendly, and super useful for analyzing data.
- Variable names should be clear and follow good practices (e.g., `my_name`, not `1name`).
