# 📘 INFO 450S — Lesson 3: Python Data Structures & APIs

In this lesson, we tackled two essential pillars of modern Python programming: **data structures** and **interacting with APIs**.

## 🧱 Core Topics

### 🗃️ Python Data Structures

We explored several foundational data structures and how to use them for real-world tasks:

- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections.
  - Accessing items by index
  - Slicing and looping
  - Adding/removing items
- **Tuples**: Ordered but immutable collections — useful for fixed sets of values like coordinates.
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pair structures for fast lookup.
  - Creating and updating dictionaries
  - Using `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()`
  - Nesting: List of dictionaries and dictionaries with tuples as keys

We also performed **basic data analysis** using:
- Aggregation methods like `sum()`, `min()`, `max()`, and average calculations
- Working with structured data like a `students` list of dictionaries containing names, ages, and grades

### 🌐 APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)

At the end of the notebook, we introduced **API calls** — how to connect Python to external data services. Key takeaways included:

- What APIs are and why they're useful
- How to make a simple GET request using Python
- Understanding JSON responses
- How to parse and use API data within your own programs

## 🔧 Skills You Practiced

- Structuring and organizing data using built-in Python containers
- Looping through nested data
- Applying logic to extract or compute values
- Making external API requests and handling structured results

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This lesson built the groundwork for **data-driven programming** in Python. Whether you're analyzing sales, scraping the web, or working with large datasets, you'll need to:
1. Organize data efficiently (data structures), and
2. Connect to external sources (APIs).

Everything you did in this notebook is a building block toward creating useful, intelligent programs.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Always comment and structure your code clearly—especially when working with nested data or external inputs.

📝 **Reminder:** For homework and future assignments, include markdown explanations between code cells to walk through your logic. Your explanations are as important as your code!
